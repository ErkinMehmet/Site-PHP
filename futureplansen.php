Although I am a junior engineer right now, I am not working in my own field, but in planning of food production. However, I do like my job, because I am the type of person who likes to look forward and to plan things in advance, so that things could happen in an more organized way. There are many challenges in my work as well, as a result of the high diversity of our products and tons of last minute changes.

My future plan is to become a good programmer, since programming is my life passion. I want to make it as my profession and create a lot of fantastic programs that are to impress the people!</p>
